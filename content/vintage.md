      <strong>/ˈvin(t)ij/ A wine of high quality, prime, best choice,
      select.</strong>

      Though related to wine in origin, the word VINTAGE has gravitated to the meaning of “good old”, of heirloom, and encompasses characteristics of dignity, legacy, and craftsmanship; the kind of value that is only acquired through time. <br><br>

      David has a sweet spot for the art of old, and for him, time has also made the difference. 		

      In his travels and due to his relentless desire to learn, he has developed a fascination and the skills 

      to treat Jewelry as very fine art.

      It is a pleasure for him to restore beauty.
