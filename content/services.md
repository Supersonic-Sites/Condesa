    desc: "If you have a totally unique and creative design in mind that isn’t
      captured by an already existing piece, no problem! We’re here to bring
      your idea to life. At Condesa, we can make a piece of jewelry out of
      anything. Sketch your vision out on a napkin, and we can do it. The beauty
      in custom design is finding perfection in the process. We relish the
      opportunity to create something unique and new, something that
      encapsulates a part of you. Choose gold, platinum, palladium, and silver,
      and any kind of gemstone you can think of (and even ones you can only
      dream up) for your special design. "

      beloved dog Roxy had passed away and he wanted a precise representation of
      her face on a gold pendant.  Not a mere engraved likeness but rather a
      partial relief sculped bust.<br><br>

      Several jewelers in his community had told him this was not possible.  Without knowing exactly how we would do this, I said yes.   He provided us with dozens of photos from which we were able to create a 3d model of his pet that was so close it left him speechless.
