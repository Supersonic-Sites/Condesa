          quick, accommodating and went way above and beyond for me. Not only do
          they have reasonable pricing, but effectively quick service as well! I
          can't recommend them enough, and I will be a returning customer.

          unique personal jewellery designs. David Is a magician! Mia is
          delightful to chat with, and has helped me refine and select pieces of
          jewellery that I was interested in. I will definitely return for
          future jewellery purchases.

        desc: Excellent service and a beautiful result. Condesa (David (designer) & Mia)
          were clear, friendly, and upfront—I liked that every step of the
          process was explained to me and totally clear! They inspected the
          ring’s original metal content and gems to check that it was worth
          working on.
