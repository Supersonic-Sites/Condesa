      David has been designing, developing, manufacturing and repairing jewelry
      for nearly 30 years, working with and learning from many of the world’s
      best designers, artists & artisans. He started in the jewelry trade in
      Mexico during the early 1990's making large silver electroformed jewelry.
      As jewelry trends began to change and designs got smaller, he learned the
      art of casting, working with a wide variety of precious metals. Searching
      for jewelry design perfection and manufacturing precision, he was at the
      forefront of digital integration back in the early 2000’s – a pioneer in
      the use of robotics, lasers, CAD and 3D printing in jewelry.<br><br>

      In addition to metal work, David has a fascination with gemstones and the study of gemology. He holds a G.G degree from the prestigious GIA. Upon moving to Vancouver in 2017, he opened the doors of the Condesa Jewelry Expertise.<br><br>

      David has lived for long periods of his life in the USA, Israel, Mexico and Canada.  He is fluent in several languages including English, Hebrew, and Spanish.  He has also been a yoga and meditation practitioner for most of his adult life.

      Monyca is just a support system. A Mexican born mother of 2, Monyca
      married David and moved to Vancouver following a grandson and a dream:
      freedom of fear. <br><br>

      Together they have walked the walk of migration and have restarted life at an unlikely age.

      She is the one who pushes and pulls (sometimes at a price!), in charge of perpetuating the style in the store and coherence in the flow. She is devoted to Beauty, Life and Delight.<br><br>

      “I never thought much of jewelery until I met David. He has shown me a world of melting and transforming, of brilliance and colour, of vibration and history, endless possibilities of manifestation: Beauty, Emotion and Grace made tangible.”
