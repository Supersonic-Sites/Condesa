      Monyca is just a support system. A Mexican born mother of 2, married David
      and moved to Vancouver following a grandson and a dream: freedom of fear.
      <br><br>

      Together they have walked the walk of migration and have restarted life at an unlikely age.

      She is the one who pushes and pulls (sometimes at a price!), in charge of perpetuating the style in the store and coherence in the flow. She is devoted to Beauty, Life and Delight.<br><br>

      “I never thought much of jewelery until I met David. He has shown me a world of melting and transforming, of brilliance and colour, of vibration and history, endless possibilities of manifestation: Beauty, Emotion and Grace made tangible.”

      Originally from Ireland, she moved to Canada in 2014. With a background of a fun mix of farming, ballroom dancing, poetry, marketing and even the army! The world of jewelry has been a constant throughout her life, as a child she would create her own taking pieces and elements from bijouterie she came across with and she developed a look that was unique at the time.
