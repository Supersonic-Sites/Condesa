    desc: David brought in a large silver menorah which had the base broken off.  He
      mentioned that he had taken it to several jewelers in Hong Kong as well as
      Canada but that nobody would even attempt to fix it.  Calling on our
      experience of manufacturing large silver tabletop goods and Judaica items,
      we were able to restore the heirloom without leaving a mark.

    desc: Alex has quite a collection of watches.  One day he brought in a
      particularly rare timepiece made from a special alloy of 18k white
      gold.  The face of the watch hade three visible nicks right next to the
      crystal.  After careful analysis of the alloy, we were able to laser weld
      the damaged areas, leaving no trace.

    cta: Call To Action
    desc: Joy brought in a late 19th century brooch.  The some of the flower petal
      elements and a pearl were missing.  Since she wanted to pass it on to a
      niece, it was important that it be restored and then converted to function
      as a pendant.  We were able to meticulously recreate the missing petals,
      replace the pearl and use the pin to create the hanging mechanism so it
      could be used as a pendant.
